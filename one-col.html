			Welcome to ISD
		</p>
		<h1 class="bc-feature-component__heading">Innovative, Inclusive, Progressive</h1>
		<p class="bc-feature-component__intro">The International School of Dublin (ISD) was established in 2007 and is the first accredited <a href="https://www.ibo.org/">International Baccalaureate</a> (IB) World Primary School in Ireland. It is a culturally diverse, private, not for profit school that is co-educational and non-denominational.</p>
		<p>At ISD, one of the fundamental goals of education is to encourage a love of learning. Upon a visit, you will find a welcoming and lively environment which is characterised by collaborative and purposeful activity. Students benefit from an innovative form of engagement and a broad education that promotes learning how to think instead of what to think.</p>
		<p>Small class sizes are guided by internationally experienced staff. Through inquiry, learners explore the world in which they live and ultimately develop themselves as internationally-minded citizens</p>
