						<p>We recognise the value of offering a range of extra curricular activities that appeal to our diverse community of learners and both supplement and enhance the curriculum. We also understand additional childcare is a valued option for many families.</p>
						<p>Our school offers two different services after school daily from 3:00-5:00pm. Both of these services complement one another:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>After School Care - General after school supervision provided through full time, part time or ad hoc services. Students enjoy games, crafts, indoor and outdoor play.</li>
							<li>Extra Curricular Activities - A range of activities spread across the week, example activities include: piano, guitar, yoga, football, capoeira, Japanese, Portuguese, French, dancing, cooking and sewing.</li>

Our curriculum framework is guided by six transdisciplinary themes of global significance, explored using knowledge and skills from six subject areas: language, social studies, mathematics, arts, science, physical/social/personal education.</li>
							<li>This example timetable demonstrates that students take part in four specialist subjects twice weekly: visual arts/drama, music/dance, spanish/english, physical education.

						<p>We believe that age is a key criterion in determining class placement. Our aim is to place each child in a stimulating and challenging year level that provides the best opportunities to make appropriate social interactions.</p>
						<p>The Primary Years Programme curriculum and small class sizes at ISD also facilitate appropriate differentiation.</p>
						<p>Differentiation is the process of identifying, with each learner, the most effective strategies for achieving agreed goals so that learning opportunities may be created to enable every student to develop, pursue and achieve.</p>
						<p>There is, therefore, an important link between differentiation and thoughtful and adaptive planning. Differentiation takes place throughout the teaching and learning process, during: planning, instruction and assessment.</p>
